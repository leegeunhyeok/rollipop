> [!NOTE]
> This project is under development (early alpha stage)

## Overview

A modern build tool developed to replace Metro bundler, providing enhanced performance, scalability, and a foundation for easy integration with the Rollup/Rolldown ecosystem.

It offers Yarn PnP compatibility by default and follows ecosystem-standard module resolution instead of Haste, aiming for seamless integration in large-scale monorepo environments.
