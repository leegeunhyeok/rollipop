This guide will walk you through setting up Rollipop in your React Native project.

<Callout>
Rollipop is actively developed and tested with the latest versions of React Native, targeting the **Hermes JavaScript engine** for optimal performance and compatibility.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or higher

## Installation

You have two options for getting started with Rollipop: using the automated setup command or manual installation.

### Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)

The quickest way to get started is to use `@rollipop/init`:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn']}>
  <Tab value="npm">
    ```bash
    npx @rollipop/init
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm dlx @rollipop/init
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn dlx @rollipop/init
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

This command will:

- Install Rollipop as a dev dependency
- Configure Android and iOS build scripts to use Rollipop CLI
- Create a basic `rollipop.config.ts` configuration file (if it doesn't exist)

### Option 2: Manual Installation

If you prefer to set up Rollipop manually:

#### 1. Install the package

<Tabs items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn']}>
  <Tab value="npm">
    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev rollipop
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm add -D rollipop
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn add -D rollipop
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

#### 2. Configure React Native CLI

Create or update the `react-native.config.js` file in your project root:

```js title="react-native.config.js"
module.exports = {
  commands: require('rollipop/commands'),
  /* Existing configurations */
};
```

This configuration makes Rollipop's commands available to React Native CLI, allowing you to use Rollipop seamlessly with your existing React Native build process.

<Callout type="info">
If you don't have a `react-native.config.js` file in your project, create one in the root directory with the configuration above.
</Callout>

## Next Steps

Now that you have Rollipop set up, you can:

- Learn about [Configuration](/docs/get-started/configuration) options
- Explore [CLI Commands](/docs/get-started/cli-commands)
- Check out [Features](/docs/features/dev-server) available in Rollipop
- Read about the [Plugin API](/docs/apis/plugin) to extend functionality
