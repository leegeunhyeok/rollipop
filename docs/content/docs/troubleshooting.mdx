This guide helps you diagnose and resolve common issues with Rollipop.

## Enable Debug Logging

Rollipop provides detailed debug and trace logs to help diagnose issues. These logs are disabled by default for performance reasons.

### Enable Debug Mode

Set the `DEBUG_ROLLIPOP` environment variable to enable debug and trace logging:

```bash
# Enable debug logging
DEBUG_ROLLIPOP=1 rollipop start

# Or for bundle command
DEBUG_ROLLIPOP=1 rollipop bundle --entry-file ./index.js --bundle-output ./dist/main.bundle.js
```

## Programmatic Usage

When using Rollipop programmatically, you can also enable debug logging:

```ts
// Set the environment variable before importing
process.env.DEBUG_ROLLIPOP = '1';

import * as Rollipop from 'rollipop';

const config = await Rollipop.loadConfig();
const server = await Rollipop.runServer(config, { port: 8081 });
```
