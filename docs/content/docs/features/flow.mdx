title: Flow Support
---

Rollipop provides built-in support for [Flow](https://flow.org/), a static type checker for JavaScript. Flow-annotated code is automatically transformed by stripping type annotations while preserving the runtime behavior.

## Default Configuration

By default, Rollipop processes Flow files that meet these criteria:

- File extension is `.js` or `.jsx`
- File contains `@flow` annotation in the code

```ts
{
  id: /\.jsx?$/,
  code: /@flow/
}
```

## Custom Configuration

You can customize the Flow filter to match your project's needs:

```ts title="rollipop.config.ts"
export default defineConfig({
  transformer: {
    flow: {
      filter: {
        // Only process .js and .jsx files
        id: /\.jsx?$/,
        // That contain @flow annotation
        code: /@flow/,
      },
    },
  },
});
```
