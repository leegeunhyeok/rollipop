## Development Setup

Rollipop uses [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) to manage Node.js version, ensuring consistent development environments across the team.

1. **Set up the project**:

   ```bash
   mise trust
   mise install
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Build all packages**:
   ```bash
   yarn build:all
   ```

## Testing the CLI

### Building the package

Before testing CLI commands, you need to build the package:

```bash
yarn workspace rollipop build
```

### Running CLI Commands

After building the package, you can execute commands using:

```bash
yarn workspace rollipop run execute <command> [options]
```

### Testing Core Features

To test critical features like starts dev server and builds, use the test project:

```bash
cd examples
yarn rollipop <command> [options]
```

This provides a real-world environment for testing your changes.

## Code Quality Checks

Before submitting a pull request, ensure your code passes all quality checks. Run these commands locally to catch issues early.

### TypeScript

- **Lint check**:

  ```bash
  yarn lint
  ```

- **Lint and auto-fix**:

  ```bash
  yarn lint:fix
  ```

- **Type checking**:
  ```bash
  yarn typecheck:all
  ```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Fork repository**

2. **Make your changes**: Implement your bug fix, feature, or improvement.

3. **Test locally**: Run all code quality checks mentioned above to ensure everything passes.

4. **Commit your changes**: Follow our [commit message guidelines](#commit-message-guidelines).

5. **Push and open a pull request**: Push your branch and open a PR against the `main` branch.

6. **CI approval**: After you open a PR, a maintainer will approve the CI workflow to run automated tests.

7. **CI validation**: The CI workflow will run all quality checks, build processes, and end-to-end tests. All checks must pass before your PR can be merged.

### Important Notes

- Make sure to run all quality checks locally before opening a PR. This speeds up the review process and reduces CI failures.
- The CI runs comprehensive validation including builds and E2E tests that verify the entire system works correctly.
- Address all feedback from maintainers promptly and update your PR as needed.

## Commit Message Guidelines
